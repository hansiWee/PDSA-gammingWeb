# 🕹️ PDSA-Gaming Web Application

This is an interactive web-based educational platform featuring five algorithm-driven games. Developed as a final-year academic project, this app demonstrates key concepts from **Algorithm Design and Analysis** using engaging game-based learning.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, MySQL
- **Hosting & Database**: Firebase

## 🧠 Key Algorithms Implemented

- **Minimax Algorithm** – Used in strategy games like Tic-Tac-Toe
- **Dynamic Programming** – Applied in problems like Longest Common Subsequence and Shortest Path
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm** – For advanced pathfinding logic

## 🎮 Games Included

- **Tic-Tac-Toe**
- **Eight Queens Puzzle**
- **Knight’s Tour (Chess-based)**
- **Identify Shortest Path**
- **Longest Common Subsequence**

Each game is designed to provide hands-on experience with classic algorithmic concepts, with a focus on educational value and performance optimization.
